Over the last few years, South African telecommunications companies have delivered several advertising campaigns which took direct aim at their competitors. Recently, Telkom’s new FreeMe advertisements targeted its competitors’ itemized billing charges and high peak call rates. This is not the first time Telkom has taken aim at its rivals. It has previously poked fun at Cell C’s buyout promotion and has shown how much better its data products are than Vodacom and MTN’s. Below are several prominent advertising campaigns where telecoms players promoted their products while simultaneously taking aim at a competitor. Telkom FreeMe ad makes fun of its competitors’ itemized billing and high peak call rates.  Telkom FreeMe burger and fries advert takes aim at mobile packages which offer subscribers features they do not want.  Cell C’s advertising campaign in 2011 poked fun at Vodacom, while at the same time promoting its new 900MHz HSPA+ broadband network.  Telkom’s FreeMe salon ad pokes fun at its competitors which only offer lower call rates during certain times.  MWEB’s 2012 campaign took aim at Telkom’s customer support, using the company’s helpdesk music.  Neotel took aim at Telkom’s call rates, highlighting that it is cheaper to call Telkom from Neotel than from a Telkom phone.  After Cell C launched its 99c for all calls promotion, with an accompanying “Papa’s got a brand new deal” advertisement, MTN launched a campaign poking fun at Cell C.  Cell C hit back at MTN’s advertising with its own ad, which mocked the MTN Zone promotion.  After launching its Go Big products, 8ta’s advertisements showed it was offering more value than Vodacom (red) and MTN (yellow).  In April 2013, Telkom Mobile used an advertising campaign to mock Vodacom’s Red smartphone price plan – which offered limitless voice calls and SMS messages.
