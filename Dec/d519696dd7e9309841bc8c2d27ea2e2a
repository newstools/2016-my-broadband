Adidas announced it is making its 3D technology shoes available to purchase for the first time with a limited edition release. The 3D Runner will be available for $333 via Adidas Confirmed in New York. The shoe features a 3D web structure with dense zones in high-force areas and less-dense zones in the low-force areas. The 3D Runner also features a 3D printed heel counter, which is integrated into the midsole and avoids the process of gluing or stitching. Benefits include greater elasticity, compliancy, and support. A black Primeknit upper ensures “high style, superior fit, and performance”.
