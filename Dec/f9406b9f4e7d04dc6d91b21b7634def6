A new study from NASA, using a satellite to measure the plankton levels in oceans, has found that “small, environmental changes in polar food webs significantly influence the boom-and-bust, or peak and decline, cycles of phytoplankton”. While the subject matter may not sound extraordinary, the instrument used to conduct the research is. The climate research was done using the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization aboard the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation. NASA uses the satellite to measure ocean vegetation during the day or at night, even through light cloud. The researchers have been studying plankton with the system since 2006, focussing on how changes in ice cover affect ecosystems. The satellite mission is a collaboration between NASA and France’s space agency, the Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales.
