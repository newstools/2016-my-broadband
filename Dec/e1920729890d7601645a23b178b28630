Google will no longer develop its own driverless car and will instead partner with car manufacturers to build vehicles, The Information reported. Instead of a car without a steering wheel or pedals, Google will possibly launch an autonomous ride-sharing service by the end of 2017. According to the report, Fiat Chrysler is building a new prototype for Google based on the Pacifica minivan. If testing is successful, they will be used in the commercial service. Fiat Chrysler and Google originally announced their partnership to develop self-driving minivans in May 2016.
