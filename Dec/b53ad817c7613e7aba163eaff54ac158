Scientists have discovered the first dinosaur tail preserved in amber, National Geographic reported. The dinosaur tail is believed to be 99 million years old and the amber contains bones, soft tissue, feathers, and Cretaceous-era ant and plant debris. Due to the structure of the tail, the scientists say it is unlikely the dinosaur the tail belonged to could fly. According to the report, researchers believe the tail was part of a young coelurosaur, a group of theropods that includes everything from tyrannosaurs to modern birds.
