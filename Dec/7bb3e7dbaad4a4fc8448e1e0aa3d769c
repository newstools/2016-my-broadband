The first Matrix Computer Warehouse store opened in Alberton, in 2000. Since then, Matrix has grown to a network of over 90 wholly owned and franchised stores, establishing itself as a trusted household name in personal computing hardware and accessories. If you’ve shopped at Matrix, the reason you probably go back is because you get amazing deals. You also get pretty helpful service and tech advice. It all comes with the benefit of shopping at an owner-managed store. Now Matrix is streamlining that shopping experience with a freshly rebranded look. And the first branch to be refurbished is the head office megastore in Alberton. Brighter and bolder, you still enjoy the feeling that simpler is better. Every techno widget you could possibly need is all within eyeshot from any part of the store. Within seconds you will be assisted by an extremely helpful and knowledgeable tech consultant who will make sure that your specific needs are explicitly met. The new Matrix shopping experience will be rolling out across stores during the course of next year. In the meantime, you can shop online to your tech-heart’s content at the all-new matrixwarehouse.co.za. Here, too, the shopping experience is refined, with rapid navigation straight to the items that are most important to you. In a mover-n-shaker world, simpler, better and easier is exactly the tech experience and support you want. You’ve always had that with Matrix Warehouse. Now, only better.
