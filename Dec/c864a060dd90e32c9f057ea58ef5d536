The National Consumer Commission (NCC) says it has not received any complaints from consumers about the Ford Kuga following media reports of engine overheating in the vehicles. The NCC held a meeting with vehicle manufacturer Ford SA last week. In a joint statement on Tuesday, the NCC, an entity of the Department of Trade and Industry, and Ford SA said the company undertook to conduct safety inspections on all Kuga utility vehicles that have been sold in South Africa. “The inspections will form part of precautionary measures instituted at the behest of the NCC after serious allegations of engine overheating on the Kuga vehicle surfaced in the media in recent weeks.” “The NCC has to date not received any complaints from consumers about the Kuga vehicle,” said the Commission’s spokesperson Trevor Hattingh. At the meeting which was chaired by NCC Deputy Commissioner, Thezi Mabuza, on Wednesday 14 December 2016, the company made representations to the allegations and informed the NCC of all matters related therewith, including its two separate investigations. “The company has vowed to expedite its investigation into engine overheating incidents and will report back to the NCC with its findings by end of February 2017.” Initially, a meeting between the two parties scheduled for 12 December 2016 was postponed to allow executives and technical experts from Ford to travel respectively from Europe and the United States of America to voluntarily appear before the NCC. Meanwhile, Ford has undertaken to alert all Kuga owners to take their vehicles to a nearby Ford workshop or dealership for a free safety inspection.
