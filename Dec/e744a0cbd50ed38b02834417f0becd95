FNB has made changes to its rules for free visits to its Slow lounges around the world. From January 2017, free visits to FNB’s airport and city lounges will be counted annually, rather than monthly. Free visits are based on your reward level at the time of entering the lounge, which is updated each month. Unused free visits do not roll over to the next year. If you do not meet the qualifying criteria, or you have used all your free visits, you will be charged R250 for entering the lounge. No guests will be allowed during peak times and only your first guest is free during off-peak times. Your free guest’s visit will be deducted from your visits for the year. Guests beyond the first are also charged at R250 per person. FNB Premier clients previously received 2 free domestic slow lounge visits per month and 2 free visits per month to the Slow in the City lounge in Sandton. To qualify, you had to be on eBucks reward level 1 or above. Premier cardholders also have access to Slow International for a fee of R250 per cardholder, R250 per additional guest, and R50 per child between 2 and 18 – if they meet the qualifying criteria. If you do not meet the criteria for discounted visits, entry is R500. FNB Private clients previously received 4 free domestic and international lounge visits, and 2 free Slow in the City lounge visits per month. To qualify, you had to be on eBucks reward level 1 or above. Under the new rules, free visits are shared between Slow Domestic Lounges and Slow International.
