South Africa’s communications regulator ICASA is biased in favour of Vodacom and MTN and “seems to want to further entrench their domination”, said Telkom CEO Sipho Maseko. In an interview with the Sunday Times, Maseko said ICASA’s attempt to auction high-demand mobile spectrum for R12 billion was “against its own rules, anti-competitive, and detrimental to consumer interests”. The spectrum auction was blocked when Telecommunications Minister Siyabonga Cwele took legal action against ICASA. Vodacom and MTN SA easily beat Telkom and Cell C when it comes to subscriber numbers in the country, but Maseko wants to challenge this dominance. The company’s recent financial results show that Telkom mobile subscriber numbers are growing and the division is starting to make money. Telkom needs more spectrum for this to continue, said Maseko. “Spectrum allocation needs to be done within a policy framework that ensures we build an industry that is competitive, enables broadband access, and generates the right returns,” says Maseko. He said ICASA was vulnerable to pressure from “giant operators”. “The notion of auctioning spectrum because of pressure is not right. Those who have should not get more of what they have.” Maseko said that “whoever gets the spectrum must have the capacity to add maximum value”. A recent analysis by MyBroadband showed that Telkom makes the least-efficient use of its spectrum compared to Vodacom, MTN, and Cell C. Despite this, Maseko said auctioning spectrum would result in a “continuation of a duopoly in the market” and prices would not come down. Maseko added that he does not support the view of nationalising privately-owned spectrum – as put forward in the recent ICT Policy White Paper.
