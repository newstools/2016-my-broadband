Bose has launched new headphones, dubbed Hearphones, which enable you to control the sound around you to make it easier to follow conversations. With Bose Hearphones, you can “turn down the distractions in noisy environments and focus on what you want to hear”. “Active Noise Reduction improves the listening comfort of conversations and takes the edge off the background noise,” said Bose. The headphones are paired with a Bose Hear app, which helps users to customise sound levels. The Bose Hear App presets also let users save audio settings for different environments.
