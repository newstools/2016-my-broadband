Internet Solutions Managing Director Saki Missaikos said MWEB will be run as a separate entity after its planned acquisition. On 2 December, Internet Solutions announced it had entered an agreement to acquire MWEB Connect for an undisclosed sum. The transaction is subject to approval from the relevant competition authorities and shareholders. If successful, the transaction is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2017. “MWEB is one of South Africa’s largest consumer ISPs and this acquisition will immediately give Internet Solutions a presence in the large and rapidly-growing consumer market,” said Missaikos. Questions have been raised on how MWEB will be integrated into Internet Solutions, and whether MWEB and AlwaysOn will merge. Internet Solutions told MyBroadband that AlwaysOn’s strategy remains as is and it is business as usual at the company. Speaking on TalkCentral, Missaikos said MWEB “will be run separately”, adding that they hope to learn from MWEB’s operations. “They have been doing it for 15 years. They know how to do this,” said Missaikos. “We do not understand the consumer as well as MWEB does. So for us it is very much to keep it as a standalone business.” “I think the worst thing we can do is to integrate it into our areas,” he said. “From a call centre perspective, go to market, and marketing, we want to leverage what they’ve got.”
