WhatsApp has already replaced SMS as the preferred messaging platform for millions of South African mobile users – and now it is disrupting the voice market. WhatsApp offers “free” voice calls between subscribers and with increased data speeds, the quality of VoIP calls are improving. Telkom’s FreeMe packages, for example, promise subscribers “superior quality WhatsApp calls” – which now compete against traditional voice calls. Unlike Vodacom and MTN, which rely heavily on traditional voice revenues, Telkom wants to focus on giving subscribers data-centric packages. Speaking to BusinessDay TV, Maseko said “voice in essence now is dead” and that they are integrating voice, data, and other value-added services. “Customers use voice a lot less and even when they do use voice, they use WhatsApp calling or voice-over-LTE/VoIP,” he said. While lost revenue due to WhatsApp calling is a concern to mobile operators, it is not the only area of worry. There is no termination fee to terminate a WhatsApp call on another network, which means that revenue stream is also disappearing. Speaking on Radio 702, Maseko said with WhatsApp calling and VoIP you do not have to pay a termination rate. “There is a double benefit to Telkom. We carry the voice call as data and we do not have to pay a dime to any operator in termination rates.” He said WhatsApp and VoIP calling will make the termination rate debate very interesting when the current regime comes to an end.
