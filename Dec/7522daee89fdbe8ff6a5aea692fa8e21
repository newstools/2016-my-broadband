MyBroadband’s speed test servers make use of Ookla’s platform and are hosted in Teraco’s vendor-neutral data centres in Johannesburg and Cape Town. Through NAPAfrica, all network operators at its peering points are provided with a free 1Gbps connection to the MyBroadband speed test platform. MyBroadband filters speed tests based on network information from Internet service providers to ensure accurate, real-world results.
