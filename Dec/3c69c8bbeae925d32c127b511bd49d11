The Department of Basic Education has defended its decision to lower the “pass mark” for mathematics in Grades 7 to 9 to 20%. Until now, learners had to get 40% for maths in order to proceed to the next grade. Brian Schreuder, from the Western Cape Education Department, said there were concerns learners were passing other subjects but failing mathematics. “When a learner, specifically those in Grades 7 to 9, has failed mathematics it means they can’t be promoted to another level because mathematics is a compulsory pass subject,” stated a CapeTalk report. “Mathematics is a huge problem in our society. The quality and the number of passes in mathematics is a challenge,” said Schreuder. To solve the problem, the national education department issued a directive for learners who pass “everything but fail mathematics” to be considered for the new pass requirement so they can continue to FETs or Grade 10. The decision was met with outcry from the public, with people saying it damages the already-poor education standard in South Africa. Department of Basic Education DG Matanzima Mweli hit back, saying “that for a national senior certificate, you really don’t need to pass at 40% if you’re not going to do maths”. “What is the rationale of insisting that a precondition of a learner to pass should be to pass mathematics at 40% when the majority of them will not do mathematics at Grade 10?” he told Radio 702. “20% in mathematics when you are going to do mathematical literacy or technical mathematics is sufficient,” he said.
