Poynting’s Xpol-13 Antenna is ready for the 3.5GHz innovation band, which Google will soon begin testing. Google won approval to begin testing innovative 3.5 GHz wireless capabilities by using antennas on light poles and other structures in eight areas of Kansas City. These tests are intended to prove the spectrum could be shared by various users, with both LTE and Wi-Fi network working alongside radar systems used by the U.S. Navy in the 3.5GHz band. The tests could last up to 18 months and result in fast, short-range wireless connections to serve areas not reached by Google Fibre. If successful, the 3.5GHz band could evolve into a new type of Wi-Fi or even an LTE-Unlicensed band with significant commercial potential with potential wireless speeds of up to 300Mbps. Another benefit of commercialized 3.5GHz could be cheaper wireless service to lower-income residents who rely heavily on smartphone access to the Internet. The Poynting XPOL-13 provides an innovative solution for the signal enhancement of 4G/WiMax / 3.4 – 3.8 GHz networks. It is a cost-effective window, wall- or pole-mountable, dual polarized, full LTE band antenna that enhances signal reception and throughput. Incorporating two separately fed ultra wideband elements in a single housing, the antenna is equipped to provide client-side MiMo and diversity support for the networks of today and tomorrow. The Poynting XPOL-13 antenna increases signal reliability, ensures higher data throughput for users and provides a stable, high-quality connection. This improves user experience and secures client retention. It is ideal for any application using the 3.4 – 3.8 GHz LTE/WiMax network. For more information, visit the Poynting website.
