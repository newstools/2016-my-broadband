Amazon recently launched Prime Video in over 200 countries around the world, including South Africa. JustWatch, a search engine for video streaming services, estimates Prime Videoâ€™s launch catalogue in South Africa to be 255 titles strong. This is smaller than the local launch catalogues of ShowMax and Netflix, but Prime Video is cheaper than its competitors. For the first six months, Prime Video will be $2.99 per month. After the promotional launch period, the price goes up to $5.99 per month. The content on Prime Video as indexed by JustWatch is shown in the screenshot below.
