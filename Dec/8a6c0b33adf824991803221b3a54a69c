China’s Ministry of Culture has ruled that from May 2017, game publishers must post the probability “of all virtual items, props, and services” available in loot boxes. According to a report by Engadget, the recent results of loot box purchases must also be displayed on the game’s website. In gaming, a loot box gives users the chance to unlock in-game items by purchasing it with real-world money. “The Chinese government said the ruling protects the rights and interests of consumers,” stated the report.
