President Jacob Zuma plans to be the mayor of Nkandla after retirement, he said at the funeral of late struggle veteran Riot Mkhwanazi on Sunday. “When I say to people [that] when I’m going to take my pension, I am going to contest to be a councilor in my ward, people laugh,” Zuma said, prompting laughter from the crowd. “I was saying [to] someone yesterday… ‘my ambition is to be mayor of Nkandla one day’.” Mkwanazi, 83, passed away last Sunday and was laid to rest in special provincial funeral in Kwa-Dlangezwa, KwaZulu-Natal. Speaking at the funeral, Zuma went into great detail about the role Mkwanazi played to bring freedom in South Africa. Zuma and Mkwanazi spent 10 years together on Robben island. “We are laying to rest one of the best of our movement. He is part of a generation that is sadly leaving us now, because age will always catch up with anyone. “[They] delivered a freedom that looked far beyond our reach. They were prepared to give it all – even their lives.”[Mkwanazi] taught us that leadership is all about service to your people – a passion to make a difference in our society and commitment to realise such aspirations.” News24
