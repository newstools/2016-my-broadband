NASA is sharing its best media on Pinterest and GIPHY, providing visitors an “out-of-this-world journey through animated GIFs and images of Earth and beyond”. NASA said it will post images and videos to collections on Pinterest and will share media with GIPHY – a database and search engine of animated images in GIF format. “These GIFs are accessible directly from the Twitter app. Just tap or click the GIF button in the Twitter toolbar, search for NASAGIF, and all NASA GIFs will appear for sharing and tweeting,” said NASA.
