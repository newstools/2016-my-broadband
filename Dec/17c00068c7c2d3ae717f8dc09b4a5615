The Sunday Times has published its Rich List for 2016, revealing the richest people in South Africa and the executives with the highest pay packages. The biggest salary packages in South Africa went to Richemont joint-CEOs Bernard Fornas and Richard Lepeu, who received packages of R103 million and R96 million respectively. Investec executive director Hendrik du Toit ranked third with a pay package of R86 million. The top-earning telecommunications executive was Datatec CEO Jens Montanana, with a salary package of R42 million. Former MTN CEO Raymond (Sifiso) Dabengwa, who left the company following the Nigerian fine debacle, received R41 million in salary and bonuses. The table below provides an overview of the top IT executive salaries in South Africa. Telkom’s latest annual report showed that CEO Sipho Maseko received a total pay package of R14.51 million for the financial year ended 2016. Group CFO Deon Fredericks earned R9.5 million – up from R8.67 million in 2015.

Dabengwa – whose package included a “compensation for loss of office” bonus of R24 million – earned R41 million. Vodacom CEO Shameel Joosub also did not do badly over the past year, with a pay package of over R20 million.
