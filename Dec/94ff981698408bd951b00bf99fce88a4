CliffCentral founder Gareth Cliff said his venture is making money and that they are surviving “against all odds”. CliffCentral launched on 1 May 2014, with many people questioning the viability of an online radio station in South Africa following the listenership debacle of 2Oceasvibe and Ballz Radio. Cliff also started the company without outside funding, which put pressure on him to generate revenue quickly. Two-and-a-half years on, CliffCentral is still growing. Speaking to Bruce Whitfield on CNBC Africa, Cliff said they “are not making a killing at the moment, but we are certainly managing to survive against all odds”. He said he did not know it would be a success when he started the venture and he often wondered how much pressure his “bond could take”. Despite the doubt, Cliff said he was convinced Internet radio was a suitable environment for free speech to flourish and where new talent can be showcased. “I believed in the people who I did this with, I believed in the audience, and I believed that this was an inevitable step where I had to be first,” he said. Cliff and Anthea Gardner from Cartesian Capital have teamed up to launch #Invest – a platform where “the ordinary joe” can invest in the stock market. “The investment objective is to provide clients with a portfolio which offers a consistent yield above bank interest rates, by investing in liquid assets,” said Gardner. Cliff is also looking at more options in the broadcasting market, including a full digital broadcast offering. “I have been paying a lot of attention to what has been happening in the technology space, especially in broadcast technology.” He said there are enormous opportunities in South Africa and Africa to build communities online.
