Takealot customers have taken to the company’s Facebook page to complain that they did not receive their Christmas orders before 25 December. “Still waiting for santa. 4 kids gifts still with santa. Hubby birthday gift still at dispatch. Customer service tells me well whatever the manager tells you I can tell you – there’s nothing we can do, sorry,” a customer posted on Takealot’s Facebook page. Multiple messages were posted on the page, with customers stating they were promised delivery of their orders before 25 December, but were now only scheduled to receive them this week. “I won’t be doing Christmas shopping with Takealot again. Made my order on the 30th of November and despite being told that my order would be delivered by the 23rd of December, nothing arrived,” said another customer. Takealot spokesperson Julie-Anne Walsh told News24 that it saw a “record number of online sales” over the festive season, which resulted in a small group of customers receiving late deliveries. “We anticipated and planned for the exceptionally-high volume of customer orders by bolstering our resources throughout the business,” said Walsh. “We met promised delivery dates as sent to customers in their Payment Confirmation emails for the vast majority of orders.”
