A new forensic investigation into the cause of a Ford Kuga fire, which killed driver Reshall Jimmy in December 2015, has been launched. This is the third investigation into the matter, which the family of Jimmy hopes will force Ford to take responsibility for the incident. The family believes that a mechanical or electrical fault with the Ford Kuga was to blame for the fire. The Rapport newspaper said it is in possession of an independent investigation report which shows that the fire was caused by an electrical fault in the vehicle. According to the report, the fire started behind an electrical panel board on the passenger side. Other Ford Kuga owners have also reported that their vehicles experienced sudden fires. According to the Rapport, these owners said Ford refused to investigate the cause of the fires. Keveen Jimmy, the brother of Reshall, said 17 local Kuga owners have come forward regarding their vehicles experiencing problems. John Gardiner, marketing director of Ford Europe, said they are aware of the complaints and are willing to investigate. If they find there is a defect with the Kuga, they will immediately recall it, said Gardiner. MyBroadband contacted Ford South Africa for comment, but the company did not respond by the time of publication.
