The office of the premier in North West has issued a warning about an impostor who phones unsuspecting members of the public and claims to be Premier Supra Mahumapelo. The premier’s spokesperson Brian Setswambung said the impostor has reportedly tried to solicit money from people in several provinces, including Gauteng, the Western Cape and Eastern Cape. “The office of the premier wishes to state that the premier does not go around phoning people asking for money. We call on all people who are approached by this fraudster to notify the police immediately,” said Setswambung. He said in the latest incident, the impostor contacted a member of Parliament (MP) in the Western Cape with a request for financial assistance allegedly for a student who was stranded in Cape Town. “He reportedly claimed that he was requested by the president to assist the son of an old acquaintance.” According to Setswambung, the impostor claimed he was getting ready for a visit by the president and asked the MP for R2 000.The MP became suspicious after realising that the cellphone number used was not registered, Setswambung said.
