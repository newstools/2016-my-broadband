Effective Measure’s November 2016 demographics report reveals that ADSL is the most popular way for South Africans to access the Internet on desktops. When looking at mobile devices, mobile networks (GPRS, EDGE, 3G, and LTE) are still far more popular than using a Wi-Fi network. Effective Measure is the official traffic measurement partner of the IAB South Africa and provides accurate traffic and demographics statistics for SA’s top websites. Effective Measure’s November 2016 statistics are based on 331,042 online surveys completed by local Internet users. The results showed that the majority of South Africans access the Internet through their mobile phone, using mobile data. Another interesting finding is that 8.49% of South Africans who access the Internet on a computer do so via a fibre connection. The tables below provide an overview of how South Africans access the Internet.
