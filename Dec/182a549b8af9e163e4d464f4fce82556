President Jacob Zuma’s “close friend” Atul Gupta is the seventh-richest South African, according to the Business Times Rich List. Gupta is also South Africa’s “richest black businessman”, overtaking Patrice Motsepe, according to the report. “The 47-year-old Gupta has personal wealth valued at R10 billion.” This is based on the “value of disclosed directors’ holdings in JSE-listed companies covering the period between December 2015 and November 30 this year”. The Gupta family have been accused on multiple occasions of using their influence over Zuma and the ANC government to enrich themselves – including scoring lucrative state contracts. Atul Gupta came to South Africa in 1993 and started the company which became Sahara computers. “His meteoric rise up the business ladder has largely coincided with Zuma’s presidency,” said the Sunday Times. ANC stalwart and Anglo chairman Sipho Pityana said the news of Gupta’s wealth was disturbing – considering that the number of black businessmen in the top 100 list has declined. “It is clear that under Zuma’s watch, black ownership of the economy is shrinking and the entire BEE project has regressed,” Pityana told the Sunday Times. The full report is in the Sunday Times of 11 December 2016.
