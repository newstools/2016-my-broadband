Vodacom said it has done a lot of work in the past six months to ensure its mobile network can handle the high volumes of traffic at holiday hotspots around South Africa. “We expect mobile traffic, particularly mobile data traffic, to more than double in certain places during this time of the year,” said Vodacom CTO Andries Delport. Among the investments Vodacom has made is deploying 52 temporary mobile base stations to provide coverage and capacity at key areas along the coast and at certain inland destinations. “Additionally, we completed the deployment of a further 100 permanent base stations in key holiday destinations. We have also upgraded the data capacity on 514 base stations and voice capacity on another 78 sites,” said Delport. “This means we’ll bring faster data services and improved voice quality to tens of thousands of people when and where they need it.” Vodacom said it plans to invest over R8 billion in its network this financial year, bringing its three-year investment total to R26 billion. This capital expenditure will mainly be used to expand its 2G, 3G, and 4G coverage.
