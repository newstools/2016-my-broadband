2016 has been the worst. We’ve lost legends (popular or not) of our time. Greats such as Mohamed Ali, Prince, Arnold Palmer, Fidel Castro, David Bowie and Peng Chang-kuei (the inventor of General Tso’s chicken). Even relationships that we thought were unbreakable…broke. Starting with Brexit which invariably led to Brangelina’s divorce. The Springboks had an incomprehensibly record-breaking year: We lost to Argentina, Wales, Italy and Japan (sure, that was in 2015, but don’t pretend that you aren’t still recovering), which leaves us at our lowest ever world ranking of 6th place. And then there is Trump. Hooray. In-between all of this good fortune, we have still found something to smile about. Something we all care deeply about. Something robust. Something reliable. Something so feature-rich that it feels like 2017 may be incomplete without it. Of course, it could only be DrayTek’s range of networking equipment. Need LTE, Fibre and/or xDSL in one router?
