RocketNet is rolling out its fibre all over South Africa, and is offering Uncapped fibre broadband for less than R1000p/m with no contracts. “At RocketNet we truly believe in Uncapped Internet with no contracts, and we believe this differentiates us from other FTTH providers,” says Simon Swanepoel, head of RocketNet. “We are so confident that our price is competitive that we only offer month to month subscriptions with 1 calendar months’ notice for any cancellations.” Launched earlier this year by Directel, RocketNet is also one of the first Internet service providers in SA to include IT support within its product offering. This includes installing and analysing the system a client needs, and advising consumers on how to use their Wi-Fi networks and get better signal strength. While Directel has been providing enterprise solutions on a business-to-business basis ever since it was launched in 2001, RocketNet is purely focused on the consumer experience. A key component of bringing proper WiFi solutions to customers is customer service, which is something that RocketNet prioritises. “The biggest bottle neck with internet services is that most home users don’t realise how poor their wifi really is,” adds Swanepoel. With Fibre, however, homeowners enjoy a much richer overall Internet experience, as well as the benefit of enhanced security services and even an increase in property value.
