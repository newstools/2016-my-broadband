Multiple Netgear routers are vulnerable to an arbitrary command injection and users have been advised to discontinue the use of affected devices until a fix is made available. Cert, Carnegie Mellon University, and Software Engineering institute maintains a Vulnerability Notes Database which provides information about software vulnerabilities. They warned that Netgear R7000, firmware version 1.0.7.2_1.1.93 and possibly earlier, and R6400, firmware version 1.0.1.6_1.0.4 and possibly earlier, contain an arbitrary command injection vulnerability. “By convincing a user to visit a specially-crafted website, a remote unauthenticated attacker may execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on affected routers.” “A LAN-based attacker may do the same by issuing a direct request, e.g. by visiting: http://<router_IP>/cgi-bin/;COMMAND,” it said. An exploit leveraging this vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. Community reports indicate the R8000, firmware version 1.0.3.4_1.1.2, is also vulnerable. Other models may also be affected. Users of these routers should consider discontinuing their use until a fix is available.
