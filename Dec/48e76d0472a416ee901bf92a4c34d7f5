TorrentFreak has released its list of the most downloaded movies through BitTorrent over the past week. TorrentFreak uses its estimates of the number of times a movie was downloaded for its weekly chart. “The data for our weekly download chart is for informational and educational reference only,” said TorrentFreak. We took TorrentFreak’s top 10 ranking and combined it with the most popular movies on DStv BoxOffice’s online portal and iTunes ZA – as detailed in the table below – to see which movies are hitting the mark with fans. *BoxOffice movies are not ranked in a particular order.
