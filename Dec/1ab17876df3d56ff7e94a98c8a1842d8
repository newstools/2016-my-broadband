Vox Telecom CEO Jacques du Toit described 2016 as the most exciting year in the company’s history, with its investment in fibre starting to pay off. “We are consistently connecting more than 700 FTTH customers a month and our FTTB sales are just under 200 per month,” said du Toit. This year, Vox acquired Frogfoot Networks – an open access network provider – to strengthen its position in the fibre market. This acquisition, said du Toit, is playing a huge role in aggressively growing Vox’s fibre network growth. “We have secured sufficient orders to build past 56,000 homes and have already passed in excess of 8,000 FTTB sites,” he said. Vox also launched the most competitive fibre, ADSL, and mobile voice products currently available on the market in 2016. “We have secured our position as a disrupter in the industry.” Vox’s strong fibre focus will continue in 2017, which in turn will fuel the uptake of cloud services. “With the deployment of high-speed fibre, we can see a clear transition to more cloud services from both consumer and corporate customers.” “Customers will be exposed to a lot more value added services that are truly relevant to them.”
