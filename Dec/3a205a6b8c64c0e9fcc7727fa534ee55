When FNB recently announced its Premier, Private, and Private Wealth clients must use the FNB Banking App at least once a month to earn eBucks, it did not go down well with everyone. Many FNB clients questioned why they were now forced to use the FNB Banking App to earn eBucks. Following the backlash, FNB revised the rules for its senior clients and moved the implementation date forward. FNB Premier, Private Clients, Private Wealth, and RMB Private Bank clients over 60 will not need to log in to the FNB Banking App to qualify for eBucks. The question is: Why is FNB coaxing its top clients to use the app? Potentially frustrating them or causing unhappiness. Raj Makanjee, FNB Premium CEO, said the decision to link eBucks to its banking app was in line with its commitment to drive change in banking behaviour. He said there are many advantages when using the app instead of other channels: “Our aim is to empower customers to transact conveniently and we can in fact offer them both a smart device and FNB Connect SIM contract to help them access the FNB Banking App and earn eBucks,” said Makanjee.
