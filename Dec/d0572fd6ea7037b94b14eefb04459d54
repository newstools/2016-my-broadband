The latest Hellopeter ratings reveal that Cell C has the best customer service among telecoms companies, followed by Telkom and Vox Telecom. Hellopeter relaunched its website earlier this year, adding a new consumer front end and new functionality to rank companies. As part of its relaunch, the website unveiled its hellopeter.com index (HPI) for companies. The HPI is Hellopeter’s barometer for measuring the health of an organisation’s customer service. Controlled by a set of algorithms that measure the number of reviews, sentiment, rating, response time, and conversions, the HPI ranks and rates businesses according to their customer service worth. “Every business will have an index rating out of 10, which will give you the ability to compare and benchmark any business,” stated Hellopeter. According to the HPI, Cell C has the best customer service – with a score of 3.5 out of 10. Telkom (3.2) and Vox Telecom (3.2) were ranked second and third respectively. The table below ranks South Africa’s largest telecommunications companies based on their HPI scores.
