Uber is gathering street-level mapping data of South African cities, beginning with Cape Town. “Cape Town is one of our priority markets in Africa. As we continue to grow, high-quality and accurate maps have become even more important,” Uber told MyBroadband. The collection of data is done using devices fitted to the roof of Uber cars. Cape Town is not the only city where this data collection is taking place. Uber said it works with its top driver partners to equip their cars with devices that collect street-level imagery to improve its existing mapping technology. “We are collecting crucial information about the roads and neighbourhoods most frequently travelled or visited by Uber riders.” “High-quality maps are core to the Uber experience and are essential for features such as calculating accurate ETAs and helping drivers navigate the best route from A to B.” From the street imagery captured, Uber said it can extract information that improves the Uber rider and driver experience – including: Examples of information Uber extracts from the imagery includes business names and addresses, locations, and street names. On the question of privacy, Uber said the mapping devices do not retain imagery at, or near a rider’s initial pick-up or drop-off location. “Additionally, any imagery collected is processed to improve our mapping technologies and not for publication,” said Uber. The imagery will not be posted online or be made available to the public. “To the extent that any personally-identifiable information is collected by our mapping cars, such information will be treated under our Mapping Privacy Statement.”
