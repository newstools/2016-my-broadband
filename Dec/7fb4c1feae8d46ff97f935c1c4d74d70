Eyewitness news reports that a whistleblower has released documents and board minutes to it that allege procurement fraud at the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC). According to the report, the documents show that a legitimate tender for refurbishing a studio was suddenly cancelled, then awarded to a company called Vision View. The tender was reportedly cancelled by various parties, including Motsoeneng and James Aguma, who was CFO at the time, and who is currently the acting CEO. EWN reported that the documents state that the cancellation forms part of a collusive deal to award R42 million to refurbish a multipurpose studio. Finance managers and other executives who tried to report the irregularities to the board were suspended, the EWN report said. News of the alleged procurement irregularities come amid a parliamentary inquiry into the SABC board, and a report alleging that Motsoeneng received a R33 million bonus for brokering a R553 million deal for the SABC with MultiChoice.
