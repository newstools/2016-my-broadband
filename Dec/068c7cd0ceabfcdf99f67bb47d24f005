Facebook has launched group video chats on its Messenger platform. “Group Video Chat is rolling out to Android and iOS devices, and the desktop version of Messenger, worldwide,” said Facebook. “With 245 million people making video calls in Messenger every month, now we’re bringing everyone on Messenger the ability to turn group chats into face-to-face conversations.” Facebook said users can see up to six people at a time in the group chat, with up to 50 contacts able to join and “just listen or join via voice, or be on camera”. “Once more than six people are on the call, just the dominant speaker is shown to all participants.”
