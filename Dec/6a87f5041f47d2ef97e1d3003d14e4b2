The latest beta of Chrome will include a new Not Secure warning for HTTP password and credit card pages, said Google. “Historically, Chrome has not explicitly labelled HTTP connections as non-secure. Starting in version 56, Chrome will mark HTTP pages that collect passwords or credit cards as non-secure, as part of a long-term plan to mark all HTTP sites as non-secure,” said Google. The feature will roll out over the next few weeks. To avoid being labelled unsecure, sites must secure their traffic with HTTPS and follow security guidelines. Chrome 56 will also include support for web Bluetooth, and the position: sticky CSS rule. Using the Web Bluetooth API on Android, sites will be able to connect to Bluetooth Low Energy devices with a few lines of JavaScript, said Google.
