Google is rolling out HTML5 by Default, which will disable Adobe Flash Player unless there’s a user indication that they want Flash content on specific sites. “Eventually, all websites will require the user’s permission to run Flash,” said Google. Not all users and sites will be affected immediately. “HTML5 by Default and the associated user prompts will be introduced gradually.” More details, including Site Engagement Index thresholds, are available on the Flash Roadmap Page.
