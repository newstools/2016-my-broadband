The recent outage of the flysaa.com website was due to the domains for its DNS servers being suspended for nonpayment. Domain Name System (DNS) servers translate names, such as mybroadband.co.za, into Internet Protocol addresses. These IP addresses are then used to connect to resources, such as a website’s server, on the Internet. During the SAA website outage, an investigation revealed that its nameservers were on the ipnetwork.co.za domain. The Whois record for ipnetwork.co.za shows that the account was in arrears for over a month before it was marked as paid on 19 December. It also shows that the domain is registered to Telkom’s Business Connexion (BCX) division. BCX did not appear to be aware of the issue and industry sources told MyBroadband that several of the country’s top techies hatched a plan to get the domain back up – even though payment was not made. One of BCX’s related domains, ipnoc.co.za, was unpaid until yesterday. The outstanding amounts come to R114 per domain, according to the ZA Central Registry’s Whois listings. After MyBroadband contacted BCX for comment on its unpaid domain registration fees, ipnoc.co.za was marked as paid. BCX did not provide comment on why its domains were unpaid or how many domains were affected.
