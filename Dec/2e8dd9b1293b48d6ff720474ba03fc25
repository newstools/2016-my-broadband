Afrihost is ending its Free Time ADSL promotion for select customers on 31 December 2016. The ISP said the Free Time deal – which gave users 18 hours of free ADSL data daily – will end for those with a capped data package priced at less than R299 per month. “The good news is that even though you will no longer get the full Free Time of 18 hours, you will get 8 hours of free Internet from midnight to 08:00 every day on your capped package,” said Afrihost. The announcement follows Afrihost’s decision to extend its Free Time promotion to the end of December. It was scheduled to end on 30 November. Part of the extension decision saw customers on capped packages priced at under R99 lose the free data benefit. Afrihost said to keep Free Time, users must upgrade to a capped package of R299 or more per month. The Free Time benefit for these customers is set to run until the end of January 2017. “We wanted to keep Free Time going forever. For everyone. However, as a direct result of Free Time two things happened,” said Afrihost. “Our overall usage and network costs increased dramatically, but we did not get as many new clients as we had hoped to help offset this extra cost.” “Second, many clients (understandably) downgraded their packages. This meant we found ourselves in the challenging position of earning less revenue while having to pay more expenses.” “Unfortunately, it is simply not possible to keep offering 18 hours of Free Time on all of our packages on top of the already low prices we charge per GB.” Afrihost said it had hoped to attract an influx of new customers with its Free Time promotion.
