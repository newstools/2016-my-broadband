Facebook is launching its stand-alone Events app on Android – now available in the Google Play store, TechCrunch reported. The app launched on iOS in October, allowing you to browse nearby events, see the dates of your upcoming Facebook Events and imported calendars, and aggregate wall posts and alerts from Events. Facebook said the app is designed for event seekers who want to keep up with nearby happenings. Actions you take on events in the app will also be visible and available on Facebook. This lets your friends see what you’re interested in and the events you’ve shared with them – even if they don’t have the app.
