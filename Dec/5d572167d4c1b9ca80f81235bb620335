Skype Translator, which was previously only available for Skype-to-Skype calls, has been enabled for calls to mobiles and landlines. Skype Translator is a speech translation application, with support for English, Spanish, French, German, Chinese, Italian, Portuguese, Arabic, and Russian. Skype Translator was built on developments in deep neural networks for speech recognition and Microsoft Translator’s statistical machine translation technology. Skype has started rolling out the extended Skype Translator service to members of the Windows Insider Program. “If you are a member of the program, ensure that you have the latest version of Skype Preview installed on your PC and that you have Skype Credit or a subscription,” it said. “The more Skype Translator is used, the higher the quality of translations. We’re excited about this next milestone as it expands to getting more people using Skype Translator.”
