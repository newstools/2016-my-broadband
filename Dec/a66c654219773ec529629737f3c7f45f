CareerJunction has released its latest CareerJunction Index (CJI) report, which shows a continued decrease in job advertising in the South African telecoms sector. The CJI uses data gathered from the CareerJunction website to represent labour dynamics in South Africa. While the telecoms sector was not a good place to be for jobseekers, the situation looked much better for IT professionals. The IT sector has shown a stabilising demand trend since mid-2016, following a steady increase in demand during the first half of the year. Software Development remains the most sought-after skill set on CareerJunction, where over 25,000 jobs are posted monthly. C# and .Net skills are at the forefront of market demand. The graphs below show volume trends for IT and telecoms job adverts published on the CareerJunction website over the past 12 months.
