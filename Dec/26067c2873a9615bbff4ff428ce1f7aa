Preparing for an online interview can be difficult, but there are steps you can follow to make it easier. Skype interviews are becoming more common among employers and an increasing amount of applicants will need to navigate an online interview in order to secure a position. Career Junction has offered seven tips for making a good impression in a Skype interview – as detailed below. Using a good-quality webcam and microphone is important, as this will affect how well the interviewer can see and hear you. Your Internet connection should be as fast and stable as possible, eliminating the possibility of stuttering or a low-quality feed. Before your interview, make sure your surroundings are clean and presentable. Ensure there are no clothes or untidy objects in view of the webcam before the interview begins.  Reduce the risk of any issues occurring by conducting a test interview with a friend beforehand and setting up early. However, you should have a backup plan ready in case anything goes wrong – including a backup device and Internet connection.  Dress professionally for your Skype interview, as this will make a good impression on the interviewer. Wearing formal attire also has the advantage of helping you to adopt a more serious approach to the interview.  Body language is important for a job interview and is difficult to convey over Skype. Make eye contact, sit up straight, and smile at the interviewer in order to make a good first impression.  It is difficult to show body language over Skype, so you need to control the tone of your voice. Try to sound enthusiastic and engaged to show the interviewer you are interested.  The best place for a Skype interview is a controlled environment such as your home. If you have to conduct the interview in a public place, choose somewhere with as little distraction and noise as possible.
