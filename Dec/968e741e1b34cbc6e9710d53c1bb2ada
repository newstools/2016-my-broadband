The Daily Mail recently stated that The Grand Tour is the most pirated TV show of all time. The first episode of The Grand Tour was illegally downloaded more than 7.9 million times, it said. “It has overtaken every big show, including Game Of Thrones, for the totals across different platforms,” said MUSO. This is not correct, according to TorrentFreak. “Collecting piracy statistics is far from an exact science. However, even when we look at publicly-available data it’s obvious The Grand Tour is no competition for Game of Thrones,” said TorrentFreak. “First of all, it would be virtually impossible for any new show to be the most downloaded ever if it’s up against those that have been available for years.” “Looking at the most recent list of pirated TV shows on The Pirate Bay shows that several shows outrank The Grand Tour by a wide margin, The Walking Dead in particular.” The publication said it keeps a “close eye” on the most-shared torrents for TV shows, and The Grand Tour achieved “roughly 20,000 people sharing simultaneously” at its peak. “Peanuts compared to the Game of Thrones record, which sits at over a quarter million.” It estimated that Game of Thrones episodes were downloaded over 14 million times in 2015. TorrentFreak spoke to MUSO about the statistics, and the company admitted that The Grand Tour is the “most pirated UK TV show”.
