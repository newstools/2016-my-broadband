A bug in Windows 10 PCs with the Anniversary Update is causing sudden drops in Wi-Fi connections, according to a report by InfoWorld. The Network Diagnostics troubleshooter reportedly states that “Wi-Fi doesn’t have a valid IP configuration” while dropping all connections. Microsoft said it is aware of the reported problem. “We recommend customers restart their PCs, and if needed, visit [Microsoft Support].” The report stated that “disconnect results when a machine performs a fast startup, setting the machine’s IP address to 169.x.x.x”.
