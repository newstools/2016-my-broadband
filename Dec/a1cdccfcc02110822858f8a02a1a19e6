Lotus FM listeners have had enough of listening to local music and are urging people to sign their online petition Save Lotus FM. The petition was launched by the South African Hindu Maha Sabha and calls for the 90% local music content quota to be scrapped immediately. The requirement for SABC radio stations to play 90% local music was put in place by the broadcaster’s Hlaudi Motsoeneng in May. According to the petition’s page, Lotus FM has lost a third of its listenership and suffered a decline in revenue since the quota was implemented. “The sudden, authoritarian imposition of the 90% local content on SABC radio stations has serious negative implications for minority groups, especially for South Africans of Indian descent,” stated the page. “As if this was not enough, the head of SABC, Hlaudi Motsoeneng, has suggested that the name of Lotus FM should change.” William Bird, a director at Media Monitoring Africa, said in September that broadcasting between 80-90% local content could cause the SABC further financial losses in future.
