The new MacBook Pro has caused “more people than ever before” to switch from the Apple notebook to the Microsoft Surface, according to a post on the Windows blog. “Our trade-in programme for MacBooks was our best ever and the combination of excitement for the innovation of Surface coupled with the disappointment of the new MacBook Pro – especially among professionals – is leading more and more people to make the switch to Surface,” said Microsoft. “It seems like a new review recommending Surface over MacBook comes out daily. This makes our team so proud, because it means we’re doing good work.” Despite the new MacBook Pro 13-inch and 15-inch models featuring improved hardware and the much-discussed Touch Bar, there have been complaints about the devices. This includes a 16GB RAM limit, lack of currently-supported ports (only Thunderbolt USB Type-C is present), and un-upgradeable SSD drives.
