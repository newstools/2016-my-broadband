Cape Town-based redPanda Software is rapidly growing and has recently relocated into bigger, better office space. redPanda Software is an expert in the end-to-end development and support of customised applications aimed at streamlining business processes and operations. The company began in 2009 and has since grown to a team of over 110 people, so an increase in office space was necessary. redPanda is still on an impressive growth curve and is looking to expand its team further with intermediate and senior Java developers who have at least 4 years’ experience. The company maintains a long-term view on its staff, believing that developing its team and driving the careers of its developers is key to producing good products and determining value. “We have big, blue-chip clients, which promises candidates the opportunity to skill up and work with modern technologies in the java environment,” says redPanda Software CEO Gareth Hawkey. Candidates are offered two career growth paths within the company – technical and management – and great international travel opportunities. redPanda Software promotes from within and pushes developers to grow while giving them the best tools to achieve their goals. What also sets redPanda Software apart is its company culture, which is built on two fundamental cornerstones – career growth and personal fulfilment. The new offices exemplify these cornerstones, offering employees the creative space they need to pursue their passions, or simply to kick back and relax when they need some downtime.
